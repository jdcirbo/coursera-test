Coursera Test Repository

!!!Hello World of Github!!!

This is the first repository as part of an HTML/CSS/JS course I am taking on Coursera. It appears that the course is a bit dated.... Hosting a page on Github requires a different set of steps than the video shows, but I think I figured it out. Although, instead of this nice, formatted default page, my just says 'Hi' atm. Lol. Stay tuned for more!
